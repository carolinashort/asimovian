<strong>Asimovian</strong> is a font inspired by the sleek geometry of a logotype, where letters seamlessly connect through square or circular features. Initially conceived as an uppercase typeface, it later expanded to include a set of lowercase characters, completing its alphabet.

<strong>Asimovian</strong> harmoniously blends sharp edges with rounded shapes, reminiscent of Art Deco typefaces infused with a futuristic essence, echoing the narrative allure of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.
