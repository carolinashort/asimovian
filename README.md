Asimovian is a font inspired by the sleek geometry of a logotype, where letters seamlessly connect through square or circular features. Initially conceived as an uppercase typeface, it later expanded to include a set of lowercase characters, completing its alphabet.

Asimovian harmoniously blends sharp edges with rounded shapes, reminiscent of Art Deco typefaces infused with a futuristic essence, echoing the narrative allure of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.

With a uniform weight and select glyphs crafted with idiosyncratic structures, Asimovian exudes character and distinctiveness, making it an ideal choice as a display font for specialized applications.

## About

Carolina is a designer from Buenos Aires. After 30 years of working in the industry, and part-time teaching experience in Argentina, Germany and New Zealand, took a full-time academic position at the University of Waikato. 
Her education was in traditional graphic design, with a strong emphasis on typography, which became her deep interest. In 1994 she created the experimental typeface [Miyuscules](https://github.com/carolinashort/miyuscules), one of the first Argentine digital fonts. In 1996 became a digital nomad, founded Bigital with Tomás García Ferrari, and started developing projects for clients in different countries, mainly in interactive and digital media. In 2019 she designed [Mansalva](https://github.com/carolinashort/mansalva), following by [MyNerve](https://github.com/carolinashort/MyNerve) in 2021, and keeps thinking about new typography projects, currently with other fonts under development.
